`This is a Reame file about main_panel_over.py`

I am very lucky to complete my `Mac dictionary` main panel part.

Here I want to write down some description about what I have done and what I would next.
Of course, I use Github to save my code before furthur changes.

What I have completed is as following:

* The layout of this extension
* The `About` dialog part.
* The `User Guide` part, in which I used a html panel to show my markdown code. It is much better than the plain text.
I like it.
* The `Setting` part. You know, what I have done is based on other's work. I need to know the install path. It is an alternative for 
users to set the path by hand if some of the code didn't work as desired.
* An important test has been done.
  * new words are displayed in descend frequency order.
  * In the main panel checked new word's comment is displayed.
  * One new word's comment can be edited by users, and it was saved automatically.
