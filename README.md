# Mac-self-dictionary-extension
Depending on Mac's dictionary and BetterDictionary, I want to have some good extensional features using Python.

I am using the Mac-self dictionary. In my opinion, it is elegant and tidy. Especially, when I search a word by three-finger tap function. It is perfect for me to use. I think, every one who have tried this would like it.

I have tried another third-part dictionary software on Windows platform. iCIBA from Kingsoft is the best. I like the double-Alt-key features. And words I have searched will be put into the a table automately. It also provides a small quiz for remembering the words.

You know, I am using Mac Pro now. I want to try something in Mac OS X. So, why couldnot Mac-self ditionary provide such a words table? Ar, I don't know. But, this is the fact that Apple cannot do that.

Fortunately, a good software engineer Pooria Azimi solved this problem. We can visit his github websit: https://github.com/pooriaazimi . I have tried his extension on Mac dictionary. What a beautiful work, I have to say.

After having a try, I am thinking, do I need more features? Yeah, something like the following:
I want to edit the words table file. For example, I want to add some sentence containing words for better understanding. Through Pooria Azimi's extension, I have no access to do that.

So, I tried something by using Python. If you are interested in this situation, welcome to read my Python code or write something better. Thank you very much.

After several hours working, I have realised some features I want.
Also, I met new problems.

I will writing here for better programming in the future.
1, Every time I run Python code, I got words in different order.
2, I should be very cautious for editing the everyday_words.txt file to add some sentence or comments.
  There is no use for pressing Enter key because I removed all the '\n' of the file in the programme for something.
  
  Why don't you write a GUI for yourself to recite the new words?
  Also, you can add more features:
  1, check the words your recited words
  2, sum the checks of every words, then show yourself the words in another order
