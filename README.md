# Mac-self-dictionary-extension
Depending on Mac's dictionary and BetterDictionary, I want to have some good extensional features using Python.

I am using the Mac-self dictionary. In my opinion, it is elegant and tidy. Especially, when I search a word by three-finger tap function. It is perfect for me to use. I think, every one who have tried this would like it.
I have tried anothe third-part dictionary software
