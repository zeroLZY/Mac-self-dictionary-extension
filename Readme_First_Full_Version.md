After a few days of coding, I have finished the first version of this extension with full features that I want.

To back up my code, I save every code detail in my Github. And write down description of my completed features.

* Find more information about the main_panel, you can visit [[here]](https://github.com/zeroLZY/Mac-self-dictionary-extension/blob/master/Readme_main_panel_over.md)
* How does this extension works, or how do Mac users use it? -- I will show more details.
  * Get the source code of Python. By the way, your Mac absolutely is able to run Python code without installing anything.
  And I would not change my Python code to a format that your Mac can recognize directly. It would take too much time of me.
  * How to run ?
    * Copy my Python code to the Path where your terminal is installed.
    * How can your Mac terminal run Python?  Write `Python` directly, read those promotion information which will tell
    you about Python in your Mac. Yeah ,it is done.
    * Then write `python_name.py`, then my code is run sussessfully.
    * Enjoying...
  * You should read the `User Guide` firstly, which can be find in the menubar: `Help` -> `User Guide`. Or visit 
  [[User Guide]](https://github.com/zeroLZY/Mac-self-dictionary-extension/blob/master/User_Guide.md)
* Be sure that the number of your new words in Mac dictionary is more than then. --Maybe it sounds weird. But my wits are
   limited, this is what I can do now.
* This is what you would see the first time you run the extension.
![First shot]

* Mark the new words that you have remembered in the left part. Marking the new words will add the frequency of every words.
I only show you the least frequency ten words I have marked. I think it may be accord with the [[Forgetting curve]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).
I hope everyone who uses this extension would be satisfied with this feature.
* Write down your explaining phrases, comments or sentences in the right half text editor. The extension will save all changes
automatically. 
* Of course, `Close` will close the software after saving all changes.
* `Change`. This button will change new words to display if you have remembered all then new words that are displayed now.
